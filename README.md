## üìä Monitoring & Logs

The module provides comprehensive logging for all intercepted calls:

### Log Categories
- üéØ **Target Detection**: When `/camera/useTimeCode` URLs are found
- üö® **Connection Intercepts**: When connections are established to target endpoints
- üì§ **Request Data**: POST data and headers being sent
- üì• **Response Data**: JSON responses and status codes
- üîß **Response Modification**: When responses are dynamically modified

### Example Log Output
```
CameraInterceptor: üö® FOUND TARGET! https://45.12.52.108/camera/useTimeCode in com.example.app
CameraInterceptor: üéØ CONNECTING TO: https://45.12.52.108/camera/useTimeCode [POST]
CameraInterceptor: üì§ POST Data captured: 156 bytes
CameraInterceptor: üì• Response captured: 245 bytes
CameraInterceptor: üîß Modified response timing for: https://45.12.52.108/camera/useTimeCode
```

### Detailed Response Modification

```

### Viewing Logs
```bash
# Via ADB
adb logcat | grep CameraNetworkInterceptor

# Or in LSPosed Manager
LSPosed Manager > Logs > Search for "CameraInterceptor"
```

## üîß Supported Libraries & Detection

| Library | Status | Hook Points | Detection Method |
|---------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| HttpURLConnection | ‚úÖ | URL creation, connect(), streams | URL constructor, connection methods |
| OkHttp | ‚úÖ | Request builder, call execution | Request.Builder.url(), Call.execute() |
| Retrofit | ‚úÖ | Service method calls | ServiceMethod.invoke() |

## üì± Target Endpoint Examples

The module will intercept calls to `/camera/useTimeCode` on any domain or IP:

- ‚úÖ `https://45.12.52.108/camera/useTimeCode`
- ‚úÖ `http://192.168.1.100/camera/useTimeCode`
- ‚úÖ `https://api.example.com/camera/useTimeCode`
- ‚úÖ `http://10.0.0.50:8080/camera/useTimeCode`
- ‚úÖ `https://subdomain.domain.com/camera/useTimeCode`

## üîß Response Modification Details

When enabled, the module automatically modifies JSON responses containing timing fields:

### Original Response Example
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "ns": 100,
  "remain": 1799,
  "now": 79041735,
  "expiredTime": 1751505935158,
  "token": "Q3QA35NU6XA"
}
```

### Modified Response
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "ns": 100,
  "remain": 999999,
  "now": 1704267735,
  "expiredTime": 4102444800000,
  "token": "Q3QA35NU6XA"
}
```

### Modification Rules
- **`now`**: Updated to current Unix timestamp (seconds)
- **`expiredTime`**: Set to 4102444800000 (January 1, 2099)
- **`remain`**: Extended to 999999 for maximum time
- **`code`**: Ensured to be 200 for success
- **Other fields**: Preserved unchanged

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug    # Debug build
./gradlew assembleRelease  # Release build
```

### Testing
1. Install on device with LSPosed
2. Enable module and select test app
3. Trigger network calls in test app to `/camera/useTimeCode`
4. Check logcat for intercepts and modifications

### GitHub Actions
The repository includes automated building:
- Builds on push to main/master
- Creates releases with APK artifacts
- Supports both debug and release builds

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Root Required**: Needs LSPosed framework installed
- **Scope Selection**: Only monitors apps you explicitly add to module scope
- **Performance**: Minimal impact, hooks are only active when target endpoint is detected
- **Privacy**: All data stays on device, no external transmission
- **Legal**: Use only on apps you own or have permission to monitor
- **Modification**: Response modification can be disabled by setting `MODIFY_RESPONSES = false`
