          ## Camera Interceptor LSPosed Module
          
          ### Features:
          - Intercepts Camera API calls (Camera1 & Camera2)
          - Monitors network requests to `/camera/useTimeCode`
          - Supports OkHttp and Retrofit detection
          - Logs all intercepted calls to Xposed logs
          
          ### Installation:
          1. Install LSPosed framework
          2. Install this APK
          3. Enable module in LSPosed
          4. Reboot device
          
          ### Usage:
          - Check Xposed logs for intercepted calls
          - Look for "CameraInterceptor" tag in logs
          - Monitor target apps that use camera APIs
