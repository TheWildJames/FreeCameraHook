          ## Camera Network Interceptor LSPosed Module
          
          ### Features:
          - Intercepts network calls to `/camera/useTimeCode` from any IP/domain
          - Monitors HTTP & HTTPS requests
          - Supports OkHttp, Retrofit, HttpURLConnection, and more
          - Logs all intercepted calls to Xposed logs
          - Dynamic response modification with current timestamps
          
          ### Installation:
          1. Install LSPosed framework
          2. Install this APK
          3. Enable module in LSPosed
          4. Add target apps to scope
          5. Reboot device
          
          ### Usage:
          - Check Xposed logs for intercepted calls
          - Look for "CameraNetworkInterceptor" tag in logs
          - Monitor target apps that make calls to `/camera/useTimeCode`
          
          ### Response Modification:
          - Updates 'now' to current Unix timestamp
          - Sets 'expiredTime' to year 2099 (4102444800000)
          - Extends 'remain' time to 999999
          - Ensures success response codes
